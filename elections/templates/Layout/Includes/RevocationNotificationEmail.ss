<p>Dear Foundation Member,</p>
<p>According to our records, you haven't voted in at least half of the Foundation elections in the past 2 years. Per the bylaws, your membership will be suspended effective 30 days from now, on {$ExpirationDate}. This email serves as notice.</p>
<p>If you wish to remain a Member of the OpenStack Foundation you have until {$ExpirationDate} to make that request to the Secretary by visiting this page: <a href="{$TakeActionLink}">$TakeActionLink</a>.</p>
<p>If you take no action, we will automatically change your account status from "Foundation Member" to "Community Member".  As a "Community Member" you can continue to engage in many activities on OpenStack.org including submitting talks for Summits.  However, you will not have all of the rights and responsibilities of being a full Foundation Member, including voting in future Board of Directors elections.</p>
<p>If you wish to remain a Foundation Member, you have until {$ExpirationDate} to request that the Secretary reinstate your account.  You also have the option to delete your account entirely.  Either option may be selected on this page prior to the deadline: <a href="{$TakeActionLink}">$TakeActionLink</a>.</p>
<p>Jonathan Bryce
    <br/>Executive Director and Secretary, OpenStack Foundation<br/>
