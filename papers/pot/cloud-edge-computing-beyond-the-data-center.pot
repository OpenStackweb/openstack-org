# paper 2 - section 12 paragraph 87
msgid "For over a decade, centralized cloud computing has been considered a standard IT delivery platform. Though cloud computing is ubiquitous, emerging requirements and workloads are beginning to expose its limitations. With its strong data center centric view, where compute and storage resources are relatively plentiful and centralized, little or no thought was ever given to the optimization of the supporting hypervisor and management platform footprint. Few cloud developers seriously considered the requirements needed to support resource-constrained nodes reachable only over unreliable or bandwidth-limited network connections, or thought about the needs of applications that demand very high bandwidth, low latency, or widespread compute capacity across many sites."
msgstr ""
# paper 2 - section 12 paragraph 88
msgid "New applications, services, and workloads increasingly demand a different kind of architecture, one that’s built to directly support a distributed infrastructure. New requirements for availability and cloud capability at remote sites are needed to support both today’s requirements (retail data analytics, network services) and tomorrow’s innovations (smart cities, AR/VR). The maturity, robustness, flexibility, and simplicity of cloud now needs to be extended across multiple sites and networks in order to cope with evolving demands."

msgid "Recently companies have begun to apply the simplified administration and flexibility of cloud computing architectures to distributed infrastructures that span across multiple sites and networks. Organizations have an emerging need to take cloud capabilities across WAN networks and into increasingly smaller deployments out at the network edge. Though this approach is in its early days, it is becoming clear that many emerging use cases and scenarios would benefit from distributed architectures."

Based on initial community interest expressed at the OpenStack Summit Boston, a two-day workshop was held in September 2017 that brought together over 200 users and developers to start the hard work of defining relevant use cases and considering the tools and architectures needed to support them. Proof of concepts have been done and the community has a few early deployments in place. The OIF Edge Computing Group has now taken up the challenge to describe fundamental requirements of a fully functional edge computing cloud infrastructure"

msgstr ""
# paper 2 - section 13 paragraph 95
msgid "It is worth highlighting that many overlapping and sometimes conflicting definitions of edge computing exist—edge computing means many things to many people. But for our purposes, the most mature view of edge computing is that it is offering application developers and service providers cloud computing capabilities, as well as an IT service environment at the edge of a network."
msgstr ""
# paper 2 - section 13 paragraph 96
msgid "The aim is to deliver compute, storage, and bandwidth much closer to data inputs and/or end users. An edge computing environment is characterized by potentially high latency among all the sites and low and unreliable bandwidth—alongside distinctive service delivery and application functionality possibilities that cannot be met with a pool of centralized cloud resources in distant data centers. By moving some or all of the processing functions closer to the end user or data collection point, cloud edge computing can mitigate the effects of widely distributed sites by minimizing the effect of latency on the applications."
msgstr ""
# paper 2 - section 13 paragraph 97
msgid "Edge computing first emerged by virtualizing network services over WAN networks, taking a step away from the data center. The initial use cases were driven by a desire to leverage a platform that delivered the flexibility and simple tools that cloud computing users have become accustomed to."
msgstr ""
# paper 2 - section 13 paragraph 98
msgid "As new edge computing capabilities emerge, we see a changing paradigm for computing—one that is no longer necessarily bound by the need to build centralized data centers. Instead, for certain applications, cloud edge computing is taking the lessons of virtualization and cloud computing and creating the capability to have potentially thousands of massively distributed nodes that can be applied to diverse use cases, such as industrial IoT or even far-flung monitoring networks for tracking real time water resource usage over thousands, or millions, of locations."

# paper 2 - section 13 paragraph 99
msgid "Many proprietary and open source edge computing capabilities already exist without relying on distributed cloud—some vendors refer to this as “device edge.” Components of this approach include elements such as IoT gateways or NFV appliances. But increasingly, applications need the versatility of cloud at the edge, although the tools and architectures needed to build distributed edge infrastructures are still in their infancy. Our view is that the market will continue to demand better capabilities for cloud edge computing."

msgid "One of the characteristics of edge computing is that the application is strongly associated with the edge location. For telecoms, “the edge” would refer to a point close to the end user but controlled by the provider, potentially having some elements of workloads running on end user devices. For large enterprises, “the edge” is the point where the application, service or workload is used (e.g. a retail store or a factory). For the purposes of this definition, the edge is not an end device with extremely limited capacity for supporting even a minimal cloud architecture, such as an IoT or sensor device.

Since edge devices can also produce terabytes of data, taking the analytics closer to the source of the data on the edge can be more cost-effective by analyzing data near the source and only sending small batches of condensed information back to the centralized systems.

Some of these workloads are common today, including video surveillance and IoT gateways, while others, including facial recognition and vehicle number plate recognition, are emerging capabilities. With many of these, the edge computing infrastructure not only reduces bandwidth requirements, but can also provide a platform for functions that enable the value of the application—for example, video surveillance motion detection and threat recognition. In many of these applications, 90% of the data is routine and irrelevant, so sending it to a centralized cloud is prohibitively expensive and wasteful of often scarce network bandwidth.

The main characteristics of this scenario are: small hardware footprint, moving (changing network connections) and constantly changing workloads, hybrid locations of data and applications. This is one of the cases that needs infrastructure to support micro nodes—small doses of compute in non-traditional packages (not all 19in rack in a cooled data center). NaaS will require support for thousands or tens of thousands of nodes at the edge and must support mesh and/or hierarchical architectures as well as on demand sites that might spin up as they are needed and shutdown when they are done.

The concept of being able to grab remote resources on demand from other sites, either neighbors over a mesh network or from core elements in a hierarchical network, means that fluctuations in local demand can be met without inefficiency in hardware deployments."

msgid "Edge computing is not and should not be limited to just the components and architectures of OpenStack, but there are some reasons that OpenStack is particularly attractive as a platform for cloud edge computing. The Edge Computing Group is asking the open source community to begin exploring these challenges and possibilities. We recognize that there is work to be done to achieve our goals of creating the tools to meet these new requirements. We welcome and encourage the entire open source community to join in the opportunity to define and develop cloud edge computing. You can find more information about the group activities on the <a href=\"https://www.openstack.org/edge-computing/\">OpenStack Edge Computing</a> web page."
