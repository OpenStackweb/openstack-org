At that moment it struck me that today’s user expectations have truly gone from simply connected to being smartly connected. Long gone are the days of the unconnected. Everything being smartly connected places requirements that the infrastructure be intelligent! That’s our challenge and anticipation for 2020.

The 1.6 release added open tracing support. The 1.7 release introduced an early preview of virtio-fs which was purposely designed and built for Kata Containers as a replacement of 9pfs. The 1.8 release focused on hypervisor improvements including qemu 4.0 and Firecracker jailer support, adding extra security isolation for the virtual machine manager (VMM) on the host.

# paper 5 - section 57 paragraph 640
msgid "Zuul is an open source CI/CD platform designed for test-driven open source projects and software development organizations who need to gate against multiple projects and systems before landing a single patch. Since 2012, Zuul has been proven at scale as a critical part of the OpenStack development process. As more users and use cases emerged, the team has been decoupling Zuul from OpenStack-specific systems. 2018's Zuul version 3.0 release was a major landmark in making Zuul generally usable outside of the OpenStack project. In 2019 Zuul has taken general usability even futher, focusing on adding features for a variety of code review systems, cloud resource providers, and container based testing workflows."

Ironic has become a vital part of OpenStack deployments. In fact, according to the 2018 OpenStack User Survey, “adoption of Ironic grew rapidly with 24% of production deployments now relying on it, up from just 9% in 2016.” The purpose of this newly launched program was to bring more visibility to the usage of Ironic and OpenStack on bare metal. The goal of increasing visibility was to not only showcase the success of Ironic and OpenStack in bare metal, but to create an avenue for users, operators and developers to further collaborate. The launch was a success, with more than 30 users and vendors like Tencent, CERN, and Red Hat joining the program with several also contributing case studies. One of the most exciting examples of bare metal used at scale was Verizon Media. James Penick, Architect Director, spoke on the keynote stage in Denver about how they use Ironic to manage hundreds of thousands of bare metal compute resources with over 4 million cores in their data centers.

msgid "At the end of last year, Lance Bragstad, a North Dakota State University alumni and former Keystone PTL, reached out the mailing list looking for mentors to participate in a Capstone project for students at the university. Students would do real work in the community throughout the semester led by one or more mentors. Chris Hoge, Kendall Nelson, and Jeremy Stanley worked with three students to accomplish work across two different OpenStack projects. They worked on a cleanroom implementation of the puppet setup for a version control system and a migration script for moving bugs from Launchpad to StoryBoard. While the work itself was important to the OpenStack community, the skills the students learned working in a community as large and diverse as OpenStack will benefit them long after graduation."

Nations woke up and realized that data sovereignty is important and maybe nations truly need to have control of certain data? This is the normal situation when you work with banks and other heavily regulated industries like City Network does. That feeling of control has expanded dramatically - to other industries and to nations. OpenStack has again proven to be the one platform those countries and industries rely on for both private- and public offerings in order to satisfy those regulatory requirements. Innovation has crept up as a longer term key aspect in what platforms to choose - as well as how to build those hybrid solutions. The Open Infrastructure Foundation filled that void not only by delivering an improved OpenStack but also four new projects that continue to expand and allow organizations to innovate on open platforms. 2020 will be an exciting year for the OSF as the need for choice continues to expand.\" - Johan Christenson, CEO, City Network"
