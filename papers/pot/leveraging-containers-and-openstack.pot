msgstr ""
# paper 1 - section 1 paragraph 2
msgid "A few years ago, you’d build an infrastructure with applications running in virtual machines, with some bare-metal machines for legacy applications. As infrastructure has evolved, virtual machines (VMs) enabled greater levels of efficiency and agility, but VMs alone don’t completely meet the needs of an agile approach to application deployment. They continue to serve as a foundation for running many applications, but increasingly, developers are looking toward the emerging trend of containers for leading-edge application development and deployment because containers offer increased levels of agility and efficiency."
msgstr ""
# paper 1 - section 1 paragraph 3
msgid "Container technologies like <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/open-source-0\" target=\"_blank\">Docker</a> and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io\" target=\"_blank\">Kubernetes</a> are becoming the leading standards for building containerized applications. They help free organizations from complexity that limits development agility. Containers, container infrastructure, and container deployment technologies have proven themselves to be very powerful abstractions that can be applied to a number of different use cases. Using something like Kubernetes, an organization can deliver a cloud that solely uses containers for application delivery."
msgstr ""
# paper 1 - section 1 paragraph 4
msgid "But a leading-edge private cloud isn’t just about containers, and containers aren’t appropriate for all workloads and use cases. Today, most private cloud infrastructures need to encompass bare-metal machines for managing infrastructure, virtual machines for legacy applications, and containers for newer applications. The ability to support, manage and orchestrate all three approaches is the key to operational efficiency."

# paper 1 - section 1 paragraph 5
msgid "<a href=\"https://openstack.org\" target=\"_blank\">OpenStack</a> is currently the best available option for building private clouds, with the ability to manage networking, storage and compute infrastructure, with support for virtual machines, bare-metal, and containers from one control plane. While Kubernetes is arguably the most popular container orchestrator and has changed application delivery, it depends on the availability of a solid cloud infrastructure, and OpenStack offers the most comprehensive open source infrastructure for hosting applications. OpenStack’s multi-tenant cloud infrastructure is a natural fit for Kubernetes, with several integration points, deployment solutions, and ability to federate across multiple clouds."

# paper 1 - section 2 paragraph 8
msgid "There are three primary scenarios where containers and OpenStack intersect."
msgstr ""
# paper 1 - section 2 paragraph 9
msgid "The first scenario, called infrastructure containers, allows operators to leverage containers in a way that improves cloud infrastructure deployment, management, and operation. In this scenario, containers are set up on a bare-metal infrastructure, and are allowed privileged access to host resources. This access allows them to take direct advantage of compute, networking, and storage resources that container runtimes are typically trying to hide from users. The containers isolate the often complex set of dependencies that each application depends on, while still allowing the infrastructure applications to directly manage and manipulate the underlying system resources. When the time comes to upgrade an service, the upgrade can be handled without changes in dependencies disrupting co-located services."
msgstr ""
# paper 1 - section 2 paragraph 10
msgid "Modern versions of OpenStack have embraced this infrastructure container model, and it’s now normal to manage an entire lifecycle of an OpenStack deployment with a combination of orchestration tooling and containerized services. Infrastructure containers enable operators to use container orchestration technologies to solve many issues, particularly around rapidly iterating/upgrading existing software including OpenStack. Running OpenStack within containers helps operators to solve Day 2 challenges, including adding new components for services, upgrading versions of software quickly, and rapidly rolling updates across machines and data centers. This approach brings the agility of containers to the problem of OpenStack deployment and upgrades."
msgstr ""
# paper 1 - section 2 paragraph 11
msgid "The second scenario is concerned with hosting containerized application frameworks on cloud infrastructure. These can include Container Orchestration Engines (COEs) like Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, or lighter-weight container-focused services and serverless application programming interfaces (APIs). Whether on bare-metal or VMs, the OpenStack community has worked to ensure that it’s possible to deliver containerized applications on a secure, tenant-isolated cloud host. This scenario is facilitated by drivers that allow projects like Kubernetes to directly take advantage of OpenStack APIs for storage, load-balancing, and identity. It also includes APIs for provisioning managed Kubernetes clusters and application containers on demand. With these capabilities, development teams can write new containerized applications and quickly provision Kubernetes clusters on OpenStack clouds. It’s a complete application lifecycle solution that gives them the resources needed to develop, test, and debug their code, with robust automation to deploy their applications into production."
msgstr ""
# paper 1 - section 2 paragraph 12
msgid "In the final scenario, we consider the interactions between independent OpenStack and COE deployments, and in this paper particularly Kubernetes clusters. Consistency and interoperability of APIs across both OpenStack and Kubernetes clusters is the primary source of success for this scenario. For example, it’s possible for Kubernetes to directly attach to <a href=\"https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenStack Cinder</a> hosted volumes, use <a href=\"https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenStack Keystone</a> as an authorization and authentication backend, or connect to <a href=\"https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenStack Neutron</a> as a network overlay with <a href=\"https://docs.openstack.org/kuryr/latest/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenStack Kuryr</a>. Conversely, it’s possible for an OpenStack cloud to share the same network overlay as a Kubernetes cluster with Neutron drivers for projects like <a href=\"https://www.projectcalico.org\" target=\"_blank\">Calico</a>. The third scenario is less focused on how a cloud service is hosted (be it Kubernetes or OpenStack), and more on how independent services interact."

# paper 1 - section 3 paragraph 13
msgid "As noted in the introduction, the deployment and management of OpenStack has changed significantly with the rise of containers, because containers unlock new approaches to managing infrastructure code. Previous management strategies required either the creation and maintenance of heavyweight golden machine images, or using brittle state-maintaining configuration-management systems. Each approach comes with complexities and restrictions. Adding to the degree of difficulty is the management of a collection of services that all require their own dependencies that change from release-to-release. Without some form of application isolation, solving for the dependencies becomes difficult if not impossible."
msgstr ""
# paper 1 - section 3 paragraph 14
msgid "Infrastructure containers enable new OpenStack deployment projects to strike a balance between the two while elegantly solving the dependency problem. Using lightweight, independent, self-contained, and typically stateless application containers, a cloud operator gains tremendous flexibility when deploying a complex control plane. Combined with a container runtime and an orchestration engine, infrastructure containers make it possible to quickly deploy, maintain, and upgrade complex and highly available infrastructure."

An operator could choose <a href=\"https://linuxcontainers.org\" target=\"_blank\">Linux Containers</a> (LXC) or Docker for their base containers, use pre-built or custom-built application containers, and select either traditional configuration-management systems for orchestration or a more modern approach like Kubernetes.
