<p>Hello $name --</p>

<p>Thank you so much for being a speaker at the OpenStack Summit in Atlanta!</p>

<p>Did you know that presentation videos from our OpenStack Summits have already been viewed more than 500,000 times? You're one of the lucky few who got to attend the Atlanta Summit, but thousands of Stackers who couldn't attend will go to openstack.org to watch recorded sessions and review slides.</p>

<p><strong>But they can't see your slides if you don't upload them.</strong></p>

<p>Please help us! We've created an easy way for presenters to upload presentation slides and we need you to add your own media to the site. It's a really simple process that should only take about a minute.</p>

<p>Ready? Click this link to go to the upload area: <a href="http://www.openstack.org/summit-upload/Presentations/?key={$SpeakerHash}">http://www.openstack.org/summit-upload/Presentations/?key={$SpeakerHash}</a></p>

<p><strong>What kind of files do you accept?
</strong><br/>We can accept several, including OpenDocument, Powerpoint, Keynote, or PDF uploads. We can also accept a link to your presentation hosted elsewhere on the web.
</p>
<p><strong>What if I am presenting more than one session?
</strong><br/>If you are a speaker for more than one presentation, you'll see the option to upload separate slides for each presentation. 
</p>
<p><strong>What if I have co-presenters?
</strong><br/>If you have co-presenters, they'll receive this email as well. Usually one person ends up with the final slide deck. If that's you, please upload it! If not, please do us a favor and nudge the owner of the slides to upload them on your team's behalf.
</p>
<p><strong>What if my presentation is in some other format?
</strong><br/>If the presentation is hosted in a web viewable format, please provide us a link to it. If not, please send us an email and let us know what type of file you have. We'll work to figure out a way to put your presentation online.
</p>
<p><strong>When will my presentation be live?
</strong><br/>We will be uploading presentations at the end of each day of the Summit. However, due to the huge volume of presentations at this event, it may take a few days before all the presentations are available.
