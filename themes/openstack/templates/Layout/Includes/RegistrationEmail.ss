<p>Dear $FirstName {$LastName}:</p>

<p>Congratulations! As an Active Technical Contributor (ATC) you qualify for a code (expires 8/31) to get a FREE pass to the upcoming OpenStack Summit in San Diego October 15th-18th.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:  FILL OUT SURVEY TO GET CODE.  EXPIRES 8/31 AND YOU CAN ONLY USE IT _ONCE_ SO DON'T SHARE IT OR LOSE IT.</strong></p>

<p>We'd like to ask you to fill out a brief survey. Why do a survey? Two reasons. First, we'd like to better accomodate you at the summit. Second, In a few weeks we plan to publish a directory of each ATC and this survey will help us get that started. Don't worry, you'll have another chance to review your information before the directory is published. At the end of this painless little survey, you'll get your special link to register for FREE to the Summit.</p>

<p>If you have questions for us or there's anything we can do to help along the way, please let us know!</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br/>
The OpenStack Events Team</p>
