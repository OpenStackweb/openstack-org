<p>Beginning this week, Summit attendees will have the opportunity rate all of the speaking submissions to help determine which presentations are the best fit for our April Summit. We'll also have subject matter experts serving as track chairs to make sure all of our audiences are well served. <strong>We plan to have the first draft of the conference schedule by March 11 and will be notifying you if your proposal has been selected at that time.</strong> Thank you again and we look forward to seeing you in Portland!</p>

<p>Warm regards,<br/>
Todd Morey<br/>
