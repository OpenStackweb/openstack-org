<p>Dear $FirstName {$LastName}:</p>

<p>Good news! Members of the OpenStack community are now voting on which presentations they would like to see included for the OpenStack Summit April 2013 in Portland. Your presentation "{$PresentationTitle}" is one of the presentations listed. Voting will last until Monday, February 25 at 5:59 CT / 23:59 UTC.</p>

<p>PROMOTE YOUR PRESENTATION<br/>
It's a good idea to promote your presentation to your friends in the OpenStack community. Tell them to view your presentation and vote:

<p>(Note: to vote on presentations, you must be a member of the OpenStack Foundation.)</p>

<p>VOTE FOR OTHER PRESENTATIONS<br/>
If you are a member of the OpenStack Foundation, you can vote for your own presentation and others you would like to see at the summit. Please do that here:

After voting closes, track chairs will be making the final selections for the agenda with the goal of announcing speakers the week of March 11.
