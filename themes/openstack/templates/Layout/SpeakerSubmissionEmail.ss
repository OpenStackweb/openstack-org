<% end_if %>

<p>Please take a moment to review your submission online:
<a href="https://openstack.org/summit/openstack-summit-hong-kong-2013/become-a-speaker/">https://openstack.org/summit/openstack-summit-hong-kong-2013/become-a-speaker/</a>
(You'll need to log in with your email address and password. There's an option to reset your password if needed.)</p>

<p>While you can no longer add new presentations, you can make edits to any of your existing submissions until <strong>11:59PM Central, August 7, 2013</strong>. Once you are happy with your submission, here are the next steps:</p>

<p>1. Community voting for presentations will open the week of August 12 and will remain open for 7-10 days.  On the first day of voting, you'll receive an email with a public link to your presentation and we encourage you to promote and share your submission with your friends and colleagues.  Ultimately, the OpenStack Summit Track Chairs will decide on the final presentations, using the results of the community voting as input. </p>

<p>2. In mid-September you will be notified via email whether or not you were selected to speak at the Summit.  Selected speakers will receive a free Full Access pass to attend, and speakers who were not selected will have time to register with the Early Bird discount until October 4.</p>

<p>3. By the end of September, the official Summit Schedule will be published on openstack.org.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your submission. Good luck! We look forward to seeing you at the OpenStack Summit Hong Kong.</p>
