	<p>	Thank you for submitting a speaking proposal for the November OpenStack Summit In Paris.  We received an incredible 1,000+ submissions for the Paris Summit, and had to make some tough decisions for the schedule.</p> 

	<p>Unfortunately, your <% if UnacceptedTalksCount == 1 %>submission was<% else %>submissions were<% end_if %> not chosen to be part of the official agenda this time around. You submitted:</p>

	<ul>

	<% loop UnacceptedTalks %>
	<li>$PresentationTitle</li>
	<% end_loop %>

	</ul>

	<p>There is, however, an opportunity to have a speaking platform at the Summit that you may want to pursue. At the Paris Summit we will again offer the #vbrownbag Tech Talks platform for brief presentations. The TechTalks offer a forum for community members to give ten (10) minute presentations. TechTalks have a small in-person audience and will be recorded and published to YouTube If you are interested in participating in the #vbrownbag TechTalks please complete this submission form: <br/>
