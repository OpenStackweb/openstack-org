						<p>
							Build your own private cloud, on your own hardware and in your own data centers, remotely managed by OpenStack experts. If you don't have (or want) in house experts to manage your cloud infrastructure, this option provides you an on-premise cloud with a fully-managed service model.

						<h5>Hosted Private Cloud</h5>
						<p>
							You don't need your own data centers to run your own cloud. OpenStack providers can get you all the benefits of private cloud without any of the on-side hardware. There's usually an option to have your hosted private cloud completely managed for you.

						<h5>Public Cloud</h5>

							Perhaps the easiest way to get started is making use of one of the worldwide OpenStack powered public clouds. Get access to compute, storage and networking in minutes and only pay for what you use.

			<h3 class="marketplace-title">Why Not Both?</h3>
			<p>
				Of course, there's no reason why you can't do both public and private cloud (a "hybrid" approach.) The power of OpenStack is the many ways you can deploy it and you'll find OpenStack in private data centers, public clouds, edge environments - or any combination of the three.
