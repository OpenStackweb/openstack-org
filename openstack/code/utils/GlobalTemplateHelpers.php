     *
     * If the method to call is not included for a particular template variable, a method named the same as the
     * template variable will be called
     *
     * If the casting class is not specified for a particular template variable, ViewableData::$default_cast is used

     * The first letter of the template variable is case-insensitive. However the method name is always case sensitive.

     *  - template name (no key)
     *  - template name => method name
     *  - template name => array(), where the array can contain these key => value pairs
     *     - "method" => method name
     *     - "casting" => casting class to use (i.e., Varchar, HTMLText, etc)
