# Video app for Summits

This module provides a robust frontend view of all videos for summit presentations, allowing filtering by summit, speaker, search, and featured/latest videos, with passive pushes from the server to the client.

## Getting Started

### Migration

`framework/sake dev/build flush=1`

It is also critical to run a migration task to populate the `PresentationVideo` table and infill all of the legacy `Presentation` records that were not created for early summits. 

`framework/sake dev/tasks/VideoPresentationMigration`

## Installation

* Create a `SummitVideoApp` page somewhere in the SiteTree, and title the page appropriately (e.g. `/summit/videos`)
* In the _Summit Videos_ admin tab, choose one video to be featured by clicking the "Set as Featured" button on its edit form.
* Select a few videos to be highlighted by checking their "highlighed" checkbox

## Configuration

There are several configurable settings made available to the developer to tailor the user experience.

In `summit-video-app/_config/config.yml`:
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Setting name</th><th>Description</th><th>Default value</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>default_speaker_limit</td><td>Number of speakers returned by default</td><td>20</td></tr>
<tr><td>popular_video_view_threshold</td><td>Number of views a video needs to be in the "popular" section</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>popular_video_limit</td><td>Number of popular videos</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>video_poll_interval</td><td>Frequency, in milliseconds, that the app passively refreshes state</td><td>15000</td></tr>
<tr><td>video_view_throttle</td><td>How long, in seconds, a user has to wait before adding a view the same video</td><td>10</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Deprecations

This module should deprecate the `VideoPresentation` table.

## Contributing

* Run `$ npm install` in the `source/` directory
* Run `$ npm run start` in the `source/` directory to start the Webpack dev server

In dev mode, the Javascript and CSS assets will be loaded from the local webpack dev server instead of the web server.  This provides hot reloads of CSS and Javascript, meaning most of the time, reloading the browser is unnecessary. Further, changes to React components will hot reload in the browser and persist their state.

The determination to use the dev server is based on the outcome of the `$WebpackDevServer` template accessor.

## Releasing

All assets that will be shipped to production, including images, need to be declared in `index.js`, which serves as a manifest the production build. Ideally, the `source/` folder should not be deployed to production.

To run a production build:

`npm run build`

## Tests

Client side tests for Redux stores, reducers, and actions:

`npm run test`

Integration and unit tests for `PresentationVideo` and `SummitVideoApp_Controller`:

`framework/sake dev/tests/SummitVideoAppTest`


## API endpoints

All video result sets are limited to `default_video_limit` in the config (50).
