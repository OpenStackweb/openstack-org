# OpenStack Foundation Website

## What is it?

This project includes the code that powers the openstack.org website, which is itself powered by a PHP web application called Silverstripe, and we've made several customizations to meet the specific needs of OpenStack. More about the Silverstripe CMS is available here: http://silverstripe.org/

This repository is designed to help other project members develop, test, and contribute to the openstack.org website project, or to build other websites. Note that this project is based on ther code that powers the public openstack.org website , not the openstack cloud software itself. To participate in building the actual OpenStack cloud platform software, go to: http://wiki.openstack.org/HowToContribute

## Why release the source?

The OpenStack.org website helps promote OpenStack, the open source cloud computing platform. We felt it only make sense to share the code that powers our website so that other open source projects might benefit, and so that developers in our community might help us improve the code that powers the website dedicated to promoting their favourite open source project.

## What's not included

Images - You'll note many missing images throughout the site. This is due to one of the following: trademark restrictions (see above), copyright restrictions, OpenStack sponsors, file size restrictions.

## A reminder on trademarks

In light of the trademarks held by the OpenStack Foundation, it is important that you not use the code to build a website or webpage that could be confused with the openstack.org website, including by building a site or page with the same look and feel of the openstack.org site or by using trademarks that are the same as or similar to marks found on the openstack.org site.
